      <p>
        At Co-optex, we understand the concerns of our customers regarding the
        privacy and security of their personal information while using our
        website. We assure you that the information provided on our website will
        only be used for the intended purpose, such as processing orders and
        maintaining customer accounts for research purposes. We are committed to
        protecting your privacy and will not share, sell, or rent your personal
        information to any other company. However, in some situations, we may be
        required to provide all information collected about a customer to third
        parties outside our group companies, including financial or
        non-financial companies as permitted by law. This may include responding
        to judicial process, regulatory authorities, or law enforcement
        agencies, or to protect against fraud, money laundering, or other risks.
        We reserve the right to release information to local, state, central, or
        international law enforcement officials when required by law or by order
        of a court or authorized administrative agency. Non-personal information
        may be used for marketing research and analytical purposes, only in
        aggregate form, by ourselves or with marketing partners, advertisers, or
        others.

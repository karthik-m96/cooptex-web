        Co-optex provides delivery through courier companies to most locations
        for all products sold on our website. The delivery time is a minimum of
        7 business days, excluding Sundays and public holidays, from the day the
        order is booked and payment is completed on Co-optex. The day of booking
        and payment is considered day 0. Please note that there may be a delay
        in delivery due to stock unavailability or technical issues, which will
        not be considered in the shipment date/days.

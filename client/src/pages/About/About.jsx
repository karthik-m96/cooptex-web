          Though the history of Weavers' co-operative dates back to the first
          quarter of 20th century, strictly speaking serious efforts were made
          in the year 1934-35 to bring large number of weavers in TamilNadu
          under the co-operative fold to strengthen entire handloom sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, in TamilNadu there are 1,134 Handloom Weaver Co-operative
          Societies functioning in TamilNadu as on 31.03.2021. As per 2019-20,
          4th All India Handloom Census, there are 2.44 lakh handloom weavers in
          the State. During the year 2020-2021, the Handloom Weavers
          Co-operative Societies have produced cloth valued at Rs.847.65 crore
          and sold Handloom Products to the extent of Rs.1027.01 crore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since all these societies were scattered and were unable to market
          their handloom products individually, formation of a state level apex
          marketing cooperative was considered necessary to market procured
          handloom products through the network of outlets in and outside of
          TamilNadu thus providing ensured marketing support. It is only in this
          context, the TamilNadu Handloom Weavers’ Co-operative Society Limited,
          popularly known as “Co-optex” was established in 1935.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Co-optex is the largest apex handloom weavers’ cooperative society in
          India promoting handloom industry and the interest of cooperative
          weavers on a commercially viable manner. Its main functions are
          organization of production according to the needs and taste of market,
          procurement of stock from handloom weavers’ cooperative societies and
          marketing of those products through its effective network of shops
          throughout the country. It also provides technical and financial help
          to the weavers.
